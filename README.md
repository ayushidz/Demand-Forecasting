# Demand-Forecasting
### Demand Forecasting with Random Forest
This project demonstrates how to build a demand forecasting model using Random Forest. The model is trained on historical sales data and can predict future demand based on user inputs.

##### Features
Data preprocessing: Handles missing values, outliers, and date conversion.
Feature engineering: Adds lag features and moving averages.
Model training: Uses Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation: Includes metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared, and visualizes results.
Interpretation: Utilizes SHAP values to explain model predictions.
User interface: Allows users to input data and get predictions.
